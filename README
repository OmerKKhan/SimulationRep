This traffic simulation was developed as part of the Final Year Project in FAST-NU Lahore under the supervision of Dr. Yasir Niaz Khan. The project is titled Adaptive Traffic Control System. In the project a traffic resolution algorithm was developed which was optimized using genetic algorithm. This simulation was developed as a fitness function to find the average waiting time of all cars in the simulation for varying volume of traffic and different chromosomes. The simulation has been made public so that developers working on the same kind of projects may use this simulation instead of developing from scratch. Everyone who sees this as a challenge is most welcome to improve this for the open source community.
Cheers!
Team Adaptive Traffic Control System.
